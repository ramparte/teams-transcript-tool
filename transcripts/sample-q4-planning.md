## Transcript

**John Smith** (00:00:01)  
Hello everyone, welcome to today's meeting.

**Sarah Johnson** (00:00:05)  
Thanks for having me. I'd like to start with the Q4 roadmap.

**John Smith** (00:00:09)  
Great, let's dive in. What are the top priorities?

**Sarah Johnson** (00:00:13)  
The analytics dashboard redesign is our primary focus for this quarter.

**Michael Chen** (00:00:19)  
I agree with Sarah. We should also consider the API integration work.

**John Smith** (00:00:25)  
Good points. Let's break this down into specific action items.

**Sarah Johnson** (00:00:30)  
I can take the lead on the dashboard. Michael, can you handle the API side?

**Michael Chen** (00:00:35)  
Absolutely, I'll coordinate with the backend team.

**John Smith** (00:00:39)  
Perfect. Sarah, what's the timeline looking like for the dashboard?

**Sarah Johnson** (00:00:44)  
I'm estimating about six weeks for the initial release. We'll need design reviews at week two and four.

**Michael Chen** (00:00:50)  
The API work should align well with that. I can have the endpoints ready by week three.

**John Smith** (00:00:55)  
Excellent. Any blockers we should discuss?

**Sarah Johnson** (00:01:00)  
We need final sign-off on the design specs from the product team.

**Michael Chen** (00:01:06)  
And I'll need access to the staging environment for testing.

**John Smith** (00:01:11)  
I'll follow up on both of those today. Anything else before we wrap up?

**Sarah Johnson** (00:01:16)  
I think we're good. Thanks everyone!

**Michael Chen** (00:01:19)  
Thanks, talk soon.
